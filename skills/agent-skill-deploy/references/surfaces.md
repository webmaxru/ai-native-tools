# Deployment Surface Reference

Detailed configuration requirements and deployment mechanics for each supported surface.

## GitHub Releases

**Detection:** Git remote URL present (`git remote get-url origin`).

**Config files:** None required beyond the git repository itself.

**Deploy action:** Create a git tag and GitHub release with auto-generated notes.

**Required tools:**
- `git` — always required
- `gh` — GitHub CLI, required for automated release creation

**Version source:** Git tags (e.g., `v1.2.0`).

**Manual alternative:** Create release through the GitHub web UI at `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/new`.

**Install command for consumers:**
```bash
apm install OWNER/REPO/skills/SKILL_NAME
```

## Claude Code Marketplace

**Detection:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is optional.

**Config files:**

1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (required) — Plugin metadata with `version` field at root level:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-skills",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "...",
     "author": { "name": "..." },
     "repository": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO",
     "license": "MIT",
     "keywords": [...]
   }
   ```

2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (optional) — Marketplace listing with version in `plugins[0].version` or root `version`. If absent, the plugin is assumed to be listed by a marketplace defined in another repository. Only `plugin.json` is version-bumped in that case.
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://anthropic.com/claude-code/marketplace.schema.json",
     "name": "owner-repo",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "...",
     "owner": { "name": "..." },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "my-skills",
         "description": "...",
         "source": ".",
         "category": "development"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Deploy action:** Bump version in `plugin.json` (and `marketplace.json` if present), commit, push. The marketplace reads from GitHub directly.

**Required tools:** `git`

**Install command for consumers:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add OWNER/REPO
/plugin install PLUGIN_NAME@OWNER-REPO
```

## VS Code Plugin Marketplace

**Detection:** `package.json` exists in repository root.

**Config files:**

1. `package.json` — Standard npm package manifest with `version` field:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-skills",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "...",
     "author": { "name": "..." },
     "repository": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO",
     "license": "MIT"
   }
   ```

2. For full VS Code extension publishing, additional fields are needed:
   - `publisher` — VS Code marketplace publisher ID
   - `engines.vscode` — Minimum VS Code version
   - `main` or `browser` — Extension entry point

**Deploy actions:**
- **Push-based (default):** Bump version, commit, push. Install via "Chat: Install Plugin From Source" in VS Code Command Palette.
- **Marketplace publish (optional):** Run `vsce publish` if `vsce` is installed and publisher is configured.

**Required tools:**
- `git` — always required
- `vsce` — optional, for VS Code marketplace publishing. Install with `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`

**Install command for consumers (push-based):**
Run **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** from the Command Palette and enter:
```text
https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

## Copilot CLI Plugin Marketplace

**Detection:** `package.json` exists in repository root.

**Config files:** Same as VS Code surface — `package.json` with `version` field.

**Deploy action:** Bump version, commit, push. The Copilot CLI marketplace reads from GitHub directly.

**Required tools:** `git`

**Install command for consumers:**
```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/REPO
```
